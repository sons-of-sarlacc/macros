# Just Loot

## Introduction
Built on the shoulders of wookies. 

## Macro
This macro will loot the corpse you currently have selected, followed by any corpse around you. If you get the message `target is out of range for this action` there is likely another person killing mobs nearby. In this case just click the nearest corpse to you and it should continue looting.

### justLoot

/loot all;
