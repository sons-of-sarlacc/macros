# Center of Being

## Introduction
Built on the shoulders of wookies. 

## Macro
This macro will re-apply the center of being ability every 31 seconds. When you've not maxed your Center of Being duration, you should adjust the pause to match the duration of your buff. It may help to enable timestamps in chat by navigating to `Options > Chat tab > tick "Timestamp Incomming Messages"`, which will allow you to see how many seconds occur between Center of Being application and the buff dropping.
